2. Gameplay

2.1 Core Mechanics

    Auto-movement: Player's spaceship moves forward automatically.
    Auto-shooting: The spaceship fires weapons automatically as it moves.
    Math-Based Power-Ups: Power-ups modify weapon strength based on mathematical operations (e.g., x5, +2, -3, /6). Players must choose the best option to upgrade their weapon.
    Color Matching & N-back Challenge:
        Players start by matching gate/portal colors.
        After a certain point, a second color is introduced.
        If the N-back (current color) doesn’t match the color of the last gate/portal passed, the player loses life, points, or suffers another penalty.
        The mechanic is designed to be intuitive, allowing players to learn through experience without explicit instructions.
    Chaotic Enemy Behavior: As the game progresses, the enemies’ behavior slowly becomes more chaotic, increasing the challenge.
    Missile Defense: Enemies shoot missiles at the player, which must be tapped on to avoid losing points, life, or other penalties.
    Obstacle Dodging: The player must dodge obstacles that appear on the screen to avoid slowing down or taking damage.
    Time Factor: Players are rewarded for completing levels faster, adding an element of speed to the challenge.
    Trail Following: In later levels, players must follow a specific trail to reach the end goal, adding complexity to navigation.
    Planet Mining:
        After finding a planet, players begin mining resources.
        Mining continues automatically for a set amount of time while the player is AFK.
        To extend mining time, players can either purchase additional time or watch an ad.
        While actively playing, players can engage in memory, logic, or puzzle-based activities to speed up the mining process until they can move on.

2.2 Gameplay Loop

    Player's ship moves automatically through space.
    Enemies approach from the right side of the screen, gradually increasing in chaotic behavior.
    Player must destroy enemies before they reach the left side.
    Power-ups appear for selection, modifying weapon strength based on math operations.
    Enemies shoot missiles that must be tapped to destroy.
    Obstacles appear, requiring dodging to maintain speed.
    Collect colored orbs in specific sequences for bonuses.
    Match gate/portal colors correctly to avoid penalties.
    Follow the trail in later levels.
    Reach the finish line before time runs out.
    Planet Mining: After completing certain levels, players find planets to mine for resources, continuing even when they are AFK, with options to extend or speed up the process through active play.

2.3 Controls

    Tap power-ups to select.
    Tap missiles to destroy them.
    Swipe up/down to dodge obstacles.
    Tap colored orbs to collect them.
    Pass through gates/portals with matching colors.
    Follow the trail by swiping in the direction of the path.
    Planet Mining: Engage in memory, logic, or puzzle mini-games to speed up mining while actively playing.
